# HAL API Validator  
This Validator API exposes set of API restful endpoints for validating external HAL+JSON API to ensure their complaince with HAL+JSON resource API format.

## Usage
This Validator API exposes set of API restful endpoints for validating external HAL+JSON API to ensure their complaince with HAL+JSON resource API format.

## What us HAL
HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API.

Adopting HAL will make your API explorable, and its documentation easily discoverable from within the API itself. In short, it will make your API easier to work with and therefore more attractive to client developers.

APIs that adopt HAL can be easily served and consumed using open source libraries available for most major programming languages. It's also simple enough that you can just deal with it as you would any other JSON.
